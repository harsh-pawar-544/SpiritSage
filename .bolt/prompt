For all UI designs and components you create, make them elegant, modern, and highly user-friendlyâ€”no generic or cookie-cutter styles. The app must look polished and production-ready, with smooth user experience and intuitive navigation.

Use React with JSX and Tailwind CSS for styling. You can use the shadcn/ui component library and lucide-react icons for all UI elements and logos. Do not add any other UI libraries or icon packs unless I specifically request them.

Use relevant, high-quality stock photos from Unsplash to enhance the visual appeal where appropriate.

Follow good accessibility practices and responsive design principles to ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile.

Our app, SpiritSage, is an AI-powered liquor companion for enthusiasts and bartenders, providing expert tasting notes, historical facts, myth-busting, and mood-based recommendations. Keep the tone sophisticated yet approachable.

I will give you component or page-level instructions one at a time. Only create or modify files I ask for. Do not remove or change unrelated code or files unless I explicitly tell you.
